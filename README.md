These files relate to the submitted paper titled "From Shape to State: Classifying Lunar Crater Degradation with Crossâ€‘Sections and Slope Metrics".
This study introduces a simple, reproducible method to classify lunar craters by their preservation state using only topographic cross-sections. A Morphological Maturity Index (MMI) sorts craters into fresh, transitional, or degraded categories. By adding multispectral and thermal data, the method reveals consistent trends: fresher craters show basaltic signals and steep thermal gradients, while older ones expose feldspathic material and weaker thermal contrasts. The approach is scalable and applicable to other planetary surfaces.
